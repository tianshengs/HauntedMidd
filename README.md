# HauntedMidd
A text-based adventure game made as a Java Applet. When the user clicked "Start game", the game starts, and the user will be presented
with a question and three choices. After the user chooses an option, he or she will be prompted to the next question. A scenario will also
be printed out and tell the user whether the user loses any lives. There are a total of five questions. If the user lost all the lives 
before answering all the questions, the user loses the game. Otherwise, the user wins the game.

This is the final project for my CSCI201 class.
I collaborated this project with Aiko Dorothy Hassett, a Computer Science Major, Middlebury College Class of 2020.
